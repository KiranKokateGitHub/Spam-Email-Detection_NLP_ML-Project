# Spam-Email-Detection_NLP_ML-Project
## Introduction:

* This project provides a step-by-step guidance to build an efficient SMS spam classification model using the SMS Spam Collection dataset. By the end of this notebook, you'll have a powerful tool to help you filter out unwanted messages and ensure that your text messaging experience is smoother and safer. </span>

* The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately classifies incoming SMS messages as either ham or spam. We will use the SMS Spam Collection dataset, which consists of 5,574 SMS messages tagged with their respective labels. </span>
